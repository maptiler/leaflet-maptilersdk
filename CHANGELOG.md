### New Features
### Bug Fixes
### Others

## 2.0.0
This version is a major rework of the v1.0.0 as it is now fully compatible with ES module, yet designed to be fully backward compatible. It is now possible to use it with NPM, but appart from that, no major new features


## 1.0.0
First release. This was essentially a fork of the [MapLibre version](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-leaflet). adapted to MapTiler SDK.
